Participants include James Corden, Abbey Clancy and Keith Lemon (and his joke), with live music from Tinie Tempah and Katy B. For those preferring something softer, Gary Barlow’s Big Ben Bash Live (11.15pm, BBC1) sees the tunesmith performing hits at a specially staged concert.

Foremost among ’em, Ray Davies, Haim, the Proclaimers, Lisa Stansfield, and Dawn Penn performing her reggae number You Don’t Love Me (No, No, No). In addition, Charlie “Gap Band” Wilson’s Oops Upside Your Head will doubtless have the studio audience (and one or three viewers at home) sprawled on the floor, lustily rowing their way into 2014.

He’s a well-versed guide and on this occasion is aided by some state-of-the-art technology, which helps animate the museum’s vast collection of natural wonders, even bringing back its dodos and dinosaurs briefly from extinction. Also broadcast in 3D.

This has been a Viennese New Year tradition since what the Vienna Philharmonic’s website tactfully describes as “a dark period of Austria’s history”. In the postwar decades, this recitation of Strauss family works has become a global phenomenon, reaching millions of people in dozens of countries. There’s a British link this year, with Vivienne Westwood designing the Vienna State Ballet’s costumes.

Two years on from apparently making a great splattery mess on the pavement, Sherlock is back. But how exactly did he survive that rooftop fall? For Watson, more puzzling is the fact that Holmes failed to let him know that he was actually, you know, not dead, and the reunion between the pair isn’t as smooth as Sherlock might have expected. Soon though, a terrorist plot throws their bickering into relief, in an episode which, while feeling a bit disjointed compared with previous outings, may be the show’s funniest to date.

There’s more murder to come, though, and another whodunnit left wide open to be answered in the second series. Yes, this lukewarm effort has managed to secure one.
